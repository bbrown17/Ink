You&apos;re driving home from work, tired from a long day of writing for your local newspaper. You notice a garage sale in a green house and decide to take a look at what&apos;s being sold. Nothing there interests you; it&apos;s mostly worn out books and ripped clothes. Just as you&apos;re ready to leave, a dusty black typewriter catches your eye. Mr Baker, the man running the garage sale, sells it to you for $5. You arrive home and put the typewriter on a large wooden table in your living room. You&apos;re intrigued by your new purchase but you&apos;re also exhausted from a nonstop work day. You examine the typewriter; a few sheets of paper are already placed in it and the ink is half full. After yawning one last time, you head up to bed.

Front of the General Store
From where you stand in front of the General Store, it looks like something out of the 1950s. A little bell is tied with a string to the doorknob of its front door. The front door protrudes out from the store almost like a tunnel; the top of the door is covered in bird poop and something shiny. Through the big windows at the front of the store you can see a security guard, sleeping in the dark.

Mrs Bloom is your small, kind, neighbor. Like the typewriter, she only really likes to answer direct questions about things. Her first name is Marsa but she likes being called &quot;Mrs&quot; (with no dot) for short. She is working in front of the house.

Front of the General Store
From where you stand in front of the General Store, it looks like something out of the 1950s. A little bell is tied with a string to the doorknob of its front door. Through the big windows at the front of the store you can see a security guard, sleeping in the dark.

You can see a Front Door here.

The Purple House is the only other house on the street besides the Green House that is described by its owner&apos;s choice of paint color. The house is small and plump like the woman who has lived there for longer than anybody can remember, Mrs Bloom.

Mrs Bloom is your small, kind, neighbor. Like the typewriter, she only really likes to answer direct questions about things. Her first name is Marsa but she likes being called &quot;Mrs&quot; (with no dot) for short. She is working in front of the house.

Back Porch
The back porch of the Green House is covered in cobwebs. The air smells strongly of birds; if you closed your eyes you might think you were looking at flamingos at the zoo. The little grass that is on the ground is dead.

If you have purple ink, you need to get a special wooden spoon and mix the ink. After that, put the mixed ink on whatever surface your typewriter is on and it&apos;ll do the rest. You&apos;ll find a special spoon somewhere in my back porch. Feel free to take it.

You&apos;re driving home from work, tired from a long day of writing for your local newspaper. You notice a garage sale in a green house and decide to take a look at what&apos;s being sold. Nothing there interests you; it&apos;s mostly worn out books and ripped clothes. Just as you&apos;re ready to leave, a dusty black typewriter catches your eye. Mr Baker, the man running the garage sale, sells it to you for $5. You arrive home and put the typewriter on a large wooden table in your living room. You&apos;re intrigued by your new purchase but you&apos;re also exhausted from a nonstop work day. You examine the typewriter; a few sheets of paper are already placed in it and the ink is half full. After yawning one last time, you head up to bed.

Purple House
The Purple House is the only other house on the street besides the Green House that is described by its owner&apos;s choice of paint color. The house is small and plump like the woman who has lived there for longer than anybody can remember, Mrs Bloom.

Mrs Bloom is your small, kind, neighbor. Like the typewriter, she only really likes to answer direct questions about things. Her first name is Marsa but she likes being called &quot;Mrs&quot; (with no dot) for short. She is working in front of the house.

From where you stand in front of the General Store, it looks like something out of the 1950s. A little bell is tied with a string to the doorknob of its front door. The front door protrudes out from the store almost like a tunnel; the top of the door is covered in bird poop and something shiny.
