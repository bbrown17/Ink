You&apos;re driving home from work, tired from a long day of writing for your local newspaper. You notice a garage sale in a yellow house and decide to take a look at what&apos;s being sold. Nothing there interests you; it&apos;s mostly worn out books and ripped clothes. Just as you&apos;re ready to leave, a dusty black typewriter catches your eye. Mr Baker, the man running the garage sale, sells it to you for $5. You arrive home and put the typewriter on a large wooden table in your living room. You&apos;re intrigued by your new purchase but you&apos;re also exhausted from a nonstop work day. You examine the typewriter; a few sheets of paper are already placed in it and the ink is half full. After yawning one last time, you head up to bed.

Living Room
Your living room is very clean, but, only because you just moved into this house a few weeks ago. A dusty black typewriter sits on a large wooden table.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The typewriter is coated with a thin layer of dust. Besides a few small scratches, the body of the typewriter is black as coal. A small stack of eggshell-colored stationery is placed in the typewriter&apos;s paper table. Its keys look worn and are a faded gold color. The keys need to be pushed very hard to type anything.

Two papers have been printed out that you know you didn&apos;t type. It&apos;s as if the typewriter wrote it all by itself. The first paper is titled &quot;Instructions Paper&quot;. The second paper reads:

Find me a shiny red alarm clock from the General Store. I need to use some of its parts.

This has to have been written by the typewriter!

Front of the General Store
From where you stand in front of the General Store, it looks like something out of the 1950s. A little bell is tied with a string to the doorknob of its front door. The front door protrudes out from the store almost like a tunnel; the top of the door is covered in bird poop and something shiny. Through the big windows at the front of the store you can see a security guard, sleeping in the dark.

Mrs Bloom is your small, kind, neighbor. Like the typewriter, she only really likes to answer direct questions about things. Her first name is Marsa but she likes being called &quot;Mrs&quot; (with no dot) for short. She is working in front of the house.

Another paper has been printed out that you know you didn&apos;t type. The paper reads:

I need you to bring me purple ink. You will need to go to a house painted the same color. A house of a different color will tell you where to administer it to me. This house is the same house that I was purchased from. When you&apos;ve learned how to use the purple ink, return and do what you&apos;ve been taught.

You&apos;re driving home from work, tired from a long day of writing for your local newspaper. You notice a garage sale in a green house and decide to take a look at what&apos;s being sold. Nothing there interests you; it&apos;s mostly worn out books and ripped clothes. Just as you&apos;re ready to leave, a dusty black typewriter catches your eye. Mr Baker, the man running the garage sale, sells it to you for $5. You arrive home and put the typewriter on a large wooden table in your living room. You&apos;re intrigued by your new purchase but you&apos;re also exhausted from a nonstop work day. You examine the typewriter; a few sheets of paper are already placed in it and the ink is half full. After yawning one last time, you head up to bed.

Mrs Bloom is your small, kind, neighbor. Like the typewriter, she only really likes to answer direct questions about things. Her first name is Marsa but she likes being called &quot;Mrs&quot; (with no dot) for short. She is working in front of the house.

Bedroom
Your bedroom probably shouldn&apos;t be called that because it has no real bed and barely any room. Moving boxes take up most of what little space there is in the room. On the floor is a small yellow mattress.

Front of the General Store
From where you stand in front of the General Store, it looks like something out of the 1950s. A little bell is tied with a string to the doorknob of its front door. The front door protrudes out from the store almost like a tunnel; the top of the door is covered in bird poop and something shiny. Through the big windows at the front of the store you can see a security guard inside of the store, sleeping in the dark.
